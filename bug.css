The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

/* This will result in green, due to specificity */
#myDiv p {
  color:purple;
}

/* But this has even more specificity and is correct*/
#myDiv > p {
  color: yellow;
}
```

The unexpected behavior arises from the interaction between inheritance, specificity, and the use of the `>` (child combinator). While `#myDiv p` targets paragraphs within the `#myDiv` element and will correctly override the `div p` rule (due to the specificity of IDs), the `#myDiv > p` rule is even more specific because it targets ONLY the direct children `p` elements of the `#myDiv` element. The `>` symbol ensures the inheritance stops right there.
