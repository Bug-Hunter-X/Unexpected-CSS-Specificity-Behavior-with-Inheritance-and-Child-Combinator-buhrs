The solution involves understanding how specificity works. The `>` combinator is more specific than just selecting a child element; it only selects *direct* child elements.  The corrected CSS is:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

/* This will result in green */
#myDiv p {
  color:purple;
}

/* This will result in yellow because > has higher specificity */
#myDiv > p {
  color: yellow;
}

```
By understanding this nuance of the child combinator, the CSS behavior becomes predictable and avoids unexpected visual outcomes.
